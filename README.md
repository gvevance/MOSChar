# MOSChar - Characterise MOSFETs using the gm/Id methodology with the power of python post-processing
Extract gm/Id curves for a process given the BSIM4 model file. Useful post-processing afterwards.

Program starts at main.py. The program must be run from the directory of main.py ( "home" directory 
of the project ).

### Included features :

Demo - extract gm/Id curves , search for operating point satisfying user-defined constraints
